You can't find it, if you can't define it.
So don't waste your time with,
the next few lines if,
you can't define it.
Rewind it, if you can't find it, 
but then you'll be behind it.
The cause:
You couldn't find it!
But that's how they designed it,
shall we say magnatized it!
Pulling you away, 
now you're further behind it? 
A definite sign is,
you got to be reminded,
you can't find it, because your behind it.
I told you Rewind this!


Parallel Assignments!
Combining the Game of Life with Simon.
It's like combining, 
the mind with a design kit,
to keep you in line with.
The paths, that lead you astray
from you natural assignment! 

-- emoji head split!!! --

 NO ICONS
It's written in script.

I told you Rewind this!

The cause:
If I decided to define it.
You would still be behind it,
and unable to find it. 
Behold, those with sight who are blinded. 
They'll undermine it,
patronize it, definely deny it.
Some will even say I'm lying!
They brought in and keep buying
so tell me who I am to deny them 
I'd be better off telling them
I saw a saucer that was flying....
It's all a mind twist,
and those in defiance
don't mind it, nor mind if.
There's any correlation aligning,
their ways with Calculated Science!
Them,
won't care how I define it,
now that's
